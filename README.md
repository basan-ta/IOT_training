# IoT & Robotics Training Program - Mechi Multiple Campus, Jhapa

**Institution:** Mechi Multiple Campus, Jhapa  
**Conducted by:** Basanta Shrestha, Sudip Parajuli : BE in Electronics, Communication and Inforamation Technology   
**Duration:** 25 AUG, 2025 to 31 AUG, 2025   
**In collaboration with:** Numa Digital Farm, Biratnagar    

## üìñ Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive record and resource hub for the **IoT and Robotics Training Program** conducted at Mechi Multiple Campus. The program was designed to provide hands-on, practical experience to 6th semester BIM students in the rapidly evolving fields of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Robotics, building upon a foundation of Electronics and Communication principles.

The curriculum focused on industry-relevant technologies, primarily leveraging the powerful **ESP32** and **ESP8266** microcontrollers. Participants progressed from basic electronics concepts to implementing advanced communication protocols, culminating in integrated IoT and robotic projects.

## üéØ Objectives Achieved

The training successfully equipped participants with the skills to:
*   Interface various sensors and actuators with ESP32/ESP8266 modules.
*   Program these devices using the Arduino IDE (C++).
*   Establish communication between devices and the cloud using modern IoT protocols.
*   Design, build, and program basic robotic systems integrated with IoT capabilities.
*   Develop end-to-end IoT solutions involving data acquisition, transmission, processing, and visualization.
